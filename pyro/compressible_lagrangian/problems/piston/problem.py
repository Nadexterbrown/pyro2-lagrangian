"""
Piston-driven compression problem for Lagrangian compressible solver.

This implements a piston-driven compression problem where a moving piston
compresses gas in a tube. The piston dynamics are coupled to the gas
pressure through Newton's laws.

Problem setup:
- Gas initially at rest with uniform pressure and density
- Piston at left boundary with initial velocity
- Right boundary is rigid wall (reflecting)
- Piston compresses gas, generating pressure waves
